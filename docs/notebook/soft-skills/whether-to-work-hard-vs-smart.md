# Work Hard vs. Work Smart?

In March of 2023, I (among countless others) applied to work on the Lex Fridman podcast. 

- Unconventional questions system, with resume optional.
- Key questions to learn more about you".
- Among these was: "Is it better to work hard or work to smart? Can you justify your answer?"

Obviously, doing both is the optimal strategy for success. Nobody can work infinitely smart or infinitely hard. Therefore, if you work hard, but not smart, you’ll waste time and effort. If you focus on working smart, you’re still going to encounter problems that need to just get “brute forced” to get done on time. 

Choosing when to **work hard vs work smart** is an optimization problem. It requires wisdom, experience, knowledge, intelligence, and self-understanding. It is a **strategy-level** question.

I chose `Other` because *focusing on strategy* is the wrong starting point to define how to work. 

I believe there are four elements to any plan.

| Steps                                                                                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       | Concrete Examples                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                                                                                    | This is conceptual. an ideology or cause. something unattainable. A gradient. It’s an infinite game you play. It should come from a deep-rooted instinct.                         | 1. to earn more money at sports events   |
| Goals                                                                                      | Goals must be S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-oriented). These are states or “snapshots” of reality that make you feel instinctively satisfied. | 1. Achieve the first ever 1,200 lb squat |
| Strategies                                                                                 | These are the general approaches you to take to reach the goal. These are general actions                                                                                         |                                          |
| You may have multiple strategies. There may be conflicting strategies to achieve the goal. | 1. Strength Training                                                                                                                                                              |                                          |
2. Improve Diet
3. Take performance drugs
 |
| Tactics | This is “the work” you do… Tactics are the specific actions you take to move towards a goal. These actions create change in the world. These changes often come with side-effects. | 1. The daily weight lifting routine you follow.
2. The foods you eat and when to eat them.
3. Testosterone boosters? Trambolin? HGH? |


Tactics are actions. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Since tactics cause real change to the world around you, they always include **side-effects**. 

People typically have multiple purposes as well as multiple goals. The **side-effects** from the tactics you choose can lead to problems that conflict with other goals and purposes you’ve set. Actions also come with risk. Always.

For example, you could take performance drugs is a great strategy to get stronger, faster. Let’s call this “working smart”. If your purpose was “to earn more money at sports events”, this tactic might make sense. If your purpose was “develop longterm health”, it might be unacceptable.

The risk of bad side-effects is too high.

Once you have a crystal-clear understanding of that various purpose and goals set in your life, the question of when you should “work hard” or “work smart” is no longer a philosophical debate. Simply assess the purposes and goals in your life. When your purpose and goals are clear, picking suitable strategies and tactics becomes self-evident.

Two problems arise. The first is that people often have a poorly defined purpose and goals. 

Second, they choose a strategies and tactics they didn’t fully understand in the first place.

Back to the introductory statement, choosing ~~when to work hard vs work smart~~ ***the appropriate tactics*** requires wisdom, experience, knowledge, intelligence, and self-understanding.

You must have enough self-understanding to identify your purpose. You must have the wisdom to set a goal that will satisfy you. You must have the knowledge and intelligence to weigh out proper strategies to achieve the goal. You must have experience carrying out the tactics you choose to predict the side-effects.

I made a free Udemy course about this 3 years ago. Here’s the link:
