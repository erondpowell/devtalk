# About this Notebook

> This "notebook" is where I take extensive notes over developer topics I'm interested in. Each section is scoped to a specific language, framework, tool, or concept. Its like a "reader's digest" docs reference for myself, and whoever else wants to read it.

## What's it for?

Learning to be a developer is hard. I've chosen to start this notebook to help me organize what I've learned, come back and reference it whenever I get fuzzy, and also give public access to anybody else that wants to use it.

## Most Courses Suck

Either that or they are boring and difficult.. or both. I'm also a bad student. I learn better by aggressively diving in to a subject... Unfortunately, I'm also kinda stupid. So its always a painful process for me to learn new stuff.

## Docs Probs

When you're a total rookie, you usually can't learn from docs alone.

- Docs are typically an exhaustive body of information on a subject, and therefore include a lot of info which is overwhelming for beginners. 
- Docs are typically written to target people with pre-existing foundational knowledge. 
- Docs often avoid describing opinionated ways of doing things. But when you're getting started, you need something to copy. You need to see how other people are doing it.

## What's in this notebook?

In the first paragraph I mentioned that this notebook is broken into **sections** that cover one language, framework, tool, or concept.

A section could be over anything... Node, TypeScript, Figma, interview skills... *anything*.

## What's in a section?

When writing a section, I do the following:

- read official documentation in depth
- follow a few guides, tutorials, or courses
- note the stuff a beginner needs to know to get a clear mental map
- rewrite docs concepts in my own words
- provide my own examples
- note best-practices, common defaults, and other things *most people usually do*

A section should provide a *total lay of the land*. Then to get our hands dirty with some real-life projects, I'll try to complement the section with accompanying [recipes in the cookbook](/cookbook/whats-a-recipe.md).

Since sections are just my own well-organized notes on a topic, they are inherently *living documents*, always up for change and improvement as my understanding improves.

## Why do this?

This is an exercise for my own personal growth. Right now, I'm a software technical writer, but over time I want to grow into a world-class software engineer. 

My hope with DevTalk.fun is that it will help me:
- actually reach that goal
- make the process easier for others
- make friends and have fun!
